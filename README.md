# About Us

**Hello, my name is Andre Willomitzer, and my partner in this project is Kevan Yang! We are students at Seneca College in Toronto, Canada. This project is a passion of ours and we decided to build it together to have a space website for news and learning about different astronauts. It is also nice to be able to share it with others who are also interested in seeing space imagery and learning about it.**
